# About

Hi! My name is Frank, I am currently a Computer Science MS student at Northwestern University at the [Design Automation of Intelligent Systems Lab](http://zhulab.eecs.northwestern.edu/index.html) advised by Prof. [Qi Zhu](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~qzhu/). I also work closely with Prof. [Chao Huang](https://chaohuang2018.github.io/) at University of Southampton. Presently, I am also working as a Robotics Learning Intern at the [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](https://svl.stanford.edu/) advised by Prof. [Fei-Fei Li](https://profiles.stanford.edu/fei-fei-li). 

I received my Bachelor's Degree <i>summa cum laude</i> in Computer Science and Mathematics in 2024, also from Northwestern University. I had the privilege of collaborating with Professor [Florian Willomitzer](https://www.optics.arizona.edu/person/florian-willomitzer) and [Oliver Cossairt](https://compphotolab.northwestern.edu/people/oliver-ollie-cossairt/) at the [3DIM Lab](https://3dim.northwestern.edu/). 

I have a broad interest in robotic learning. I'm fascinated by the challenge of creating robots that can navigate complex environments and perform long-horizon tasks efficiently and safely. This interest extends from humanoid robotics to more common applications like self-driving vehicles. Looking ahead, I want to contribute to pioneering industries by refining state-of-the-art learning methods that effectively assist humans in complex tasks, while prioritizing safety alongside performance.

## Research Interests

My projects have been contributing to a common goal: creating more intelligent and adaptable robotic systems through learning-based approaches. Within robotic learning, I am particularly interested in:

***Data-Driven Control***: Designing safe model predictive control strategies capable of handling uncertainties and delays in dynamic environments.

***Runtime Verification***: Equipping robots with real-time decision-making capabilities that continuously assess the safety of learned systems, especially in the presence of neural network controlled systems.

***Skill-Based Learning***: Developing long-horizon skill acquisition from expert demonstration. This includes creating benchmark metrics and high-fidelity action primitive sim2real transfer.

## Teaching
