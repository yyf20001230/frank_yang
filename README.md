# About

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at Northwestern University. In the past, I had the privilege of collaborating with Professor [Florian Willomitzer](https://www.optics.arizona.edu/person/florian-willomitzer) and [Oliver Cossairt](https://compphotolab.northwestern.edu/people/oliver-ollie-cossairt/) at the [3DIM Lab](https://3dim.northwestern.edu/), focusing on high-precision 3D image reconstruction. Presently, my efforts are directed towards research with Professor [Qi Zhu](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~qzhu/) at the [Design Automation of Intelligent Systems Lab](http://zhulab.eecs.northwestern.edu/index.html), where I am exploring reinforcement learning approaches for safety-critical control systems.

I have a broad interest in robotic learning and control. This curiosity fuels my research vision — a commitment to contributing to the evolution of self-driving technologies. Whether applied to robotics or commodity vehicles, I envision a future where vehicles navigate roads with an optimal balance of efficiency and safety.

I deeply believe in human ingenuity and the potential of Artificial Intelligence. 10 years from now, I want to be a computer vision scientist, immersing myself in a pioneering industry capable of pushing the limit of autonomous driving.
