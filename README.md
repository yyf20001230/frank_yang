# About

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at Northwestern University. In the past, I had the privilege of collaborating with Professor Florian Willomitzer and Oliver Cossairt at the Computational Photography Lab, focusing on high-precision 3D image reconstruction. Presently, my efforts are directed towards research with Professor Qi Zhu at the Design Automation of Intelligent Systems Lab, where I am exploring reinforcement learning approaches for safety-critical control systems.

I have a broad interest in computer vision and deep reinforcement learning. This curiosity fuels my research vision — a commitment to contributing to the evolution of self-driving technologies. Whether applied to robotics or commodity vehicles, I envision a future where vehicles navigate roads with an optimal balance of efficiency and safety.

I deeply believe in human ingenuity and the potential of Artificial Intelligence. 10 years from now, I want to be a computer vision scientist, immersing myself in a pioneering industry capable of pushing the limit of autonomous driving.

Please see my [CV] for a full list of work, teaching, and other experiences.

*** High-quality 3D imaging with Commodity Devices ***

Advised by: [Florian Willomitzer](https://www.optics.arizona.edu/person/florian-willomitzer)

Assisted in creating GhostScan, a python 3D imaging framework that facilitates non-technical users to discover micro-painting degradation in Kokomo glass test tiles
Streamlined and packaged a [3-step calibration sequence](https://pypi.org/project/GhostScan/) (intrinsic, radiometric, and geometric) to PyPI, allowing µm-level precision prior to starting Phase Measuring Deflectometry
Benchmarked performance with FLIR camera on specular objects; lowered reprojection error to 0.34-pixel, decreased calibration time by 23 min
