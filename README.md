# About

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at Northwestern University. In the past, I had the privilege of collaborating with Professor Florian Willomitzer and Oliver Cossairt at the Computational Photography Lab, focusing on high-precision 3D image reconstruction. Presently, my efforts are directed towards research with Professor Qi Zhu at the Design Automation of Intelligent Systems Lab, where I am exploring reinforcement learning approaches for safety-critical control systems.

I have a broad interest in computer vision and deep reinforcement learning. This curiosity fuels my research vision — a commitment to contributing to the evolution of self-driving technologies. Whether applied to robotics or commodity vehicles, I envision a future where vehicles navigate roads with an optimal balance of efficiency and safety.

I deeply believe in human ingenuity and the potential of Artificial Intelligence. 10 years from now, I want to be a computer vision scientist, immersing myself in a pioneering industry capable of pushing the limit of autonomous driving.

**Hydejack** started out as a free blogging theme for Jekyll — and continues to be so.

<!--posts-->


## An Impressive Portfolio
A portfolio that's guaranteed to be impressive — no matter what you put into it.

## A Printable Resume
Get a resume that's consistent across the board — whether it's on the web, mobile, print, or [PDF](https://hydejack.com/assets/Resume.pdf).

## Just Markdown
Write all content with Markdown. __Hydejack__ gives you [additional CSS classes](docs/writing.md) to stylize your content, without losing compatibility with other Jekyll themes.


## Just Markup
**Hydejack** boasts a plethora of modern JavaScript, but make no mistake: It's still a _plain old web page_ at its core. It works without JavaScript and you can even view it in a text-based browser like `w3m`:

![w3m Screenshot](https://hydejack.com/assets/img/blog/w3m.png)

The Hydejack blog, as seen by the text browser `w3m`.



## Syntax Highlighting
**Hydejack** features syntax highlighting, powered by [Rouge].

```js
// file: `example.js`
document.querySelector("hy-push-state").addEventListener("hy-push-state-load", () => {
  const supportsCodeHighlights = true; //!!
});
```

Code blocks can have a filename and a caption.



## Beautiful Math
They say math is beautiful — and with **Hydejack**'s [math support][math] it's guaranteed to also look beautiful:

![Math example](https://hydejack.com/assets/img/blog/example-content-iii.jpg)

Hydejack uses KaTeX to efficiently render math.
